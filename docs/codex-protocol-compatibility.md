# Built-in Codex protocol compatibility

The reference is CLIProxyAPI commit
`a2976eb8a303f11b4ea5177bce9f9ff752634dfc`. The HappyClaw starting commit was
`930b7874e4d597e5f81cdb179a8a47ce168e2f02`. The implementation remains
TypeScript inside the HappyClaw host service; it uses Claude Agent SDK for the
agent loop and adds no Go runtime or external gateway process.

## Official Codex client request shape

The request body follows the official openai/codex client (CLI 0.162.1,
`codex-rs/core/src/client.rs` `build_responses_request`); where it and the
reference translator differ, the official client wins.

- **Body**: keys in `ResponsesApiRequest` order (`model`, `stream`,
  `service_tier`, `input`, `tools`, `tool_choice`, `parallel_tool_calls`,
  `reasoning`, `store`, `include`, `prompt_cache_key`, `text`) via
  `serializeCodexResponsesRequest`. No top-level `instructions`: the system
  prompt is a developer input item. `tool_choice` is always sent (`auto`
  unless the caller forces a choice). `include` is only
  `reasoning.encrypted_content`, plus `web_search_call.action.sources` when
  the request carries hosted web search (Claude Code builds WebSearch result
  links from the sources).
- **Responses Lite** (catalog `use_responses_lite`, every current gpt-6 and
  gpt-5.6 model): no top-level `tools`; an input-prefix
  `{ type: "additional_tools", id: "at_<uuid>", role: "developer", tools }`
  item whose tools are one `functions` namespace
  (`create_tools_json_for_responses_lite`). The id is the uuid-v5 of the
  compact tool JSON inside a uuid-v5(OID, thread) namespace; the thread is the
  caller-supplied session identity, else a hash of the system prompt.
  `parallel_tool_calls: false`, `reasoning.context: "all_turns"`, image
  `detail` stripped, replayed calls carry `namespace: "functions"`, and a
  forced single tool becomes `required`. `codexRequestUsesResponsesLite`
  decides the shape per request; the Lite HTTP header must follow it.
- **Hosted tools and Lite**: official Lite sends no hosted tools and replaces
  web search with a client-executed `web.run` tool backed by
  `/backend-api/codex/alpha/search`. That executor does not exist here, so a
  request carrying Claude's server web search stays in the classic shape
  (`{ type: "web_search", external_web_access: true, filters?,
user_location? }`). `blocked_domains` and `max_uses` have no official field
  and are dropped.
- **Classic shape** (`gpt-5.5` and unknown models): top-level function tools
  `{ type, name, description, strict: false, parameters }`, image
  `detail: "high"` (official `DEFAULT_IMAGE_DETAIL`).
- **Model traits** come from the catalog: `text.verbosity` is the model's
  `default_verbosity` when it supports verbosity (merged with
  `output_config.format` as `text.format`); `service_tier: "priority"` is sent
  only when the request asks for fast/priority and the model lists that tier.
  `reasoning.summary: "auto"` is sent unless thinking is explicitly disabled
  (product choice; official clients default to no summary). The current
  catalog gives every model `default_reasoning_summary: "none"`, and the
  backend rarely returns a readable summary even when one is requested: about
  1% of the reasoning items of `gpt-6.1-sol` in the official client's own
  sessions, `detailed` included. A reasoning block that arrives with only its
  cipher is therefore normal, not a lost summary; each proxied request logs
  `reasoningBlocks` and `reasoningSummaryChars` to tell the two apart.
- **Tool schemas**: `parse_tool_input_schema` semantics — missing root
  `properties` inserted, boolean schemas become strings, `const` becomes a
  one-value `enum`, missing types inferred, object/array children defaulted,
  unreachable root definitions pruned. Only `$ref`, `type`, `description`,
  `encrypted`, `enum`, `items`, `minItems`, `properties`, `required`,
  `additionalProperties`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `allOf`, `$defs` and
  `definitions` are kept, in that order with sorted maps. Schemas whose
  normalized JSON exceeds 5,000 bytes go through the official compaction
  passes (descriptions, definitions, objects below depth 3, compositions)
  until they fit. Invalid keyword values are dropped rather than failing the
  request.
- **Assistant content** only carries `output_text`: assistant-side images and
  documents become text placeholders.
- **Tool search** (`ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH`): `tool_search_tool_*` server tools
  are dropped, `defer_loading` tools are declared upfront, `tool_reference`
  blocks become `[Tool available: <name>]` text and server tool-search history
  is skipped.
- **Model catalog**: entries carry `use_responses_lite`, verbosity,
  `context_window`, `minimal_client_version`, `available_in_plans` and service
  tiers. Models requiring a newer client than 0.162.1 are dropped. Each
  provider also has a live catalog from
  `GET /backend-api/codex/models?client_version=0.162.1` (official headers,
  1 h cache, refreshed when `x-models-etag` changes; never awaited by
  requests). Official clients send no `If-None-Match` there, so neither does
  the gateway.
- **Background requests**: Codex gateway providers default
  `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` to `claude-haiku-5-5`, so Claude Code's
  haiku-tier calls stay recognizable and run at low effort.

## Official client alignment

Beyond the CLIProxyAPI port, the HTTP identity and transport follow the
official openai/codex client (0.162.1) directly; where the two differ, the
official client wins.

| Concern             | Aligned behavior                                                                                                  | Official source                                                                |

| Request compression | zstd level 3 when the runtime supports it                                                                         | `http-client/src/request.rs`, `features` EnableRequestCompression              |

Not adopted: `x-codex-beta-features` (`remote_compaction_v2` would advertise
remote compaction, which Claude Code's local compaction cannot honor),
`x-openai-subagent` for background requests (the official client sends none
for its own title thread), WebSocket transport (HTTP SSE remains the official
fallback) and HTTP/2 through the proxy dispatcher (experimental in the pinned
undici). Compaction windows are not tracked, so the window number stays 0.

Backend semantics below also follow openai/codex `main` (2026-10-11); the
Anthropic side follows what the Claude Code CLI expects.

## Intentional runtime differences

- HappyClaw requests `reasoning.summary: auto` for its thinking UI unless
  thinking is disabled.
- Empty tools are removed; `tool_choice` and `parallel_tool_calls` are always
  sent, as the official client does.
- HappyClaw resolves the final reasoning effort itself (disabled thinking →
  lowest supported level, haiku-tier → low, explicit Agent effort, then the
  provider's `CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` or catalog default) and clamps it to the
  current model catalog; a removed `minimal` level is normalized to `low`.
- URL images become a visible `[Image omitted: …]` placeholder. The pinned
  reference translator drops them silently; rejecting them would fail every
  later turn of a session that contains one.
- Streams buffer their first frames until content starts, so a failure before
  any content returns a real HTTP status (as CLIProxyAPI's optional bootstrap
  buffering does), and `count_tokens` is answered with a local estimate.
- Released streams send `event: ping` after 15 seconds of downstream silence
  (as magpie does), because Claude Code's idle watchdog for custom base URLs
  counts pings; the official client has no Anthropic-side equivalent.
- `invalid_encrypted_content` strips replayed reasoning and retries once
  (as magpie does); the official client has no such recovery.
- A truncated (`max_output_tokens`) or refused turn keeps Anthropic stop
  reasons (`max_tokens`, `refusal`) instead of the official stream error, and
  an incomplete tool call is never reported as runnable.
- Gateway authentication, bounded rate/body/event/aggregation budgets,
  backpressure, cancellation and idle deadlines remain in force. CLIProxyAPI's
  account pools, WebSocket continuation, distributed replay cache and management
  service are separate capabilities, outside this Messages-to-Responses port.
- Native reasoning replay travels in the SDK conversation. The actual SDK
  regression checks that the next request carries the original encrypted
  content. No shared server history cache is created.
- Streaming and nonstream thinking use the same blank-line summary separators;
  the reference's separate nonstream converter concatenates those parts.
- Malformed final tool JSON of a completed response and conflicting already
  streamed snapshots fail explicitly, instead of becoming an empty tool
  invocation or partial success.

## Verification

`tests/fixtures/codex-cliproxy-a2976.json` contains independently generated
request payloads and original Go SSE output for 34 cases. The differential test
compares all business fields after only the documented runtime normalizations;
request cases run on the classic shape and normalize the official-client
differences listed above (schema subset, image detail, verbosity, always-sent
tool controls, no `instructions`).
Golden data is generated with `scripts/reference/codex-claude-reference.go`
inside a disposable checkout of the pinned CLIProxyAPI commit. Feed the existing
corpus to the harness's standard input to regenerate it; the Go implementation
is never loaded by the HappyClaw application.

Additional tests cover interleaved tools, final-only snapshots, signatures,
schema literals, transport cancellation/failures and session isolation.
`tests/e2e/codex-gateway-sdk.mjs` runs the installed SDK and CLI against a real
local HTTP gateway and a controlled Responses SSE server. It executes Bash and
a long-name SDK MCP tool, writes actual files, replays encrypted reasoning and
checks cache-exclusive usage on the second turn. Its network boundary rejects
any request to the real subscription backend.
The second turn also exercises native search result blocks through the actual SDK.

Local/CI and Mac mini results are reported separately in the deployment evidence.
A controlled upstream is evidence of SDK/protocol compatibility; live ChatGPT
subscription access still requires a valid provider OAuth login.
