# ChatGPT/Codex subscriptions: built-in and external gateways

HappyClaw includes a ChatGPT/Codex OAuth gateway. Use the built-in login for
an account attached to a HappyClaw provider. An external gateway such as
CLIProxyAPI remains an alternative when you need a separately managed
account pool. These are two independent integrations: the built-in flow does
not read or update the host's Codex CLI login file.

## Built-in gateway

### Sign in and select a provider

1. As an administrator with system configuration access, open provider setup
   (`/setup/providers`) and choose **ChatGPT 订阅**.
2. Click **登录 ChatGPT**, open the generated authorization URL, and sign in
   with the account whose Codex access you want to use. Access depends on the
   account's current subscription and OpenAI's availability rules.
3. The OAuth redirect goes to `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback`. This is
   expected; HappyClaw does not start a callback listener on your browser's
   computer. Copy the complete callback URL from the address bar and paste it
   into HappyClaw's callback field. The URL contains the one-time code and
   state; keep it private and finish the flow within ten minutes.
4. Enable the provider, choose its target Codex model and reasoning effort,
   then select it for the workspace. Use the available model catalog rather
   than a model name copied from an old example.

HappyClaw exchanges the code with PKCE, reads the official namespaced JWT
identity claims (including `chatgpt_account_is_fedramp`), and saves OAuth
secrets encrypted in its provider secret store. A callback URL from
`localhost:1455` or `127.0.0.1:1455` is accepted; an `error=` returned by the
authorization page is shown as such. Like the official login server, a code
is sent to the token endpoint at most once unless the connection provably
never opened (DNS, refused connection, connect timeout, TLS handshake): then
the pending login is kept and pasting the same URL again retries it. After a
response timeout, an HTTP error or a dropped connection the code may already
be consumed, so the login has to start over. A new provider stores the
catalog default model and its default reasoning effort.

**重新登录 ChatGPT** replaces that provider's login, clears any refresh
failure and provider-health verdict, and lets the provider's warm runners
finish their current query and restart. Logging in with a different ChatGPT
account, or converting a non-ChatGPT provider, also stops runners and drops
the provider's saved sessions, because encrypted reasoning from one account
cannot be replayed to another. When a different account replaces a login, or
a ChatGPT provider is deleted, HappyClaw revokes the old refresh token in the
background (`POST https://auth.openai.com/oauth/revoke`, the official logout
request). The revocation is best effort: the login or deletion never waits
for it or fails because of it. A converted provider gets the catalog default
model unless it already uses a Codex catalog model. No additional Docker
gateway service or device-code-login switch is needed for this flow.

**Model and effort per conversation.** The provider's model and effort are
only defaults. In the chat composer a conversation can pin any model of the
account's catalog (the account's own `/models` list narrowed to its plan, the
global catalog until that is fetched) and a reasoning effort on it; the pick is
stored per conversation (`session_model_selections`) and applies to that
conversation's main agent and sub-agents, while the haiku-tier background
requests stay on the provider's model at low effort.

- The model reaches the runner as `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` (the OPUS, SONNET and
  SUBAGENT tiers follow it) when the runner starts. Changing it starts a new
  SDK session with the latest messages replayed from HappyClaw's history,
  like switching provider does, because encrypted reasoning only verifies for
  the model that issued it. The gateway's `invalid_encrypted_content` recovery
  works within one request only; without the new session every request after
  the change would pay one rejected attempt first. `sessions.model` records
  the model each session runs on, so a launch can tell. A session from before
  models were tracked counts as running on the provider's model.
- The effort does not travel through the SDK, which cannot express every
  level of the catalog (`ultra` is rounded down by the CLI) and which the CLI
  always overrides with its own `output_config.effort`. It is minted into the
  runner's gateway grant, and a change of the effort button updates the live
  grants of that conversation, so the next upstream request uses it and no
  runner restarts or loses its session.
- Levels above `max` (today `ultra`) can only be picked by users with
  `manage_system_config`. The server applies the rule when listing (the
  picker never sees them), when saving (`400`, `EFFORT_RESTRICTED`) and when a
  runner starts: a stored pick is re-checked against the model's levels, the
  catalog and the permissions of whoever chose it, and a stale part falls back
  to the provider default with a log line instead of failing the turn. The
  ceiling is `CODEX_SESSION_EFFORT_CEILING` in `model-catalog.ts`.

### Runtime and account isolation

```text
Claude Agent SDK (host or agent container)
       | Anthropic Messages + runner-scoped gateway token
       v
HappyClaw /gateway/chatgpt/v1/messages (loopback / private source only)
       | OAuth access token + selected ChatGPT account header
       v
ChatGPT / Codex Responses backend
```

Every runner launch — container, host process, or a one-shot host query such
as title generation — receives its own random gateway token, held only in the
service's memory and revoked when that runner or query exits. The gateway
accepts nothing else: the provider's saved key is only an internal identifier
used to find the provider at launch. The gateway also refuses requests that
carry `Forwarded`/`X-Forwarded-*`/`X-Real-IP` headers or come from a
non-loopback, non-private address, so it is not reachable from the public
internet even though it shares the web port. The upstream OAuth secrets never
leave the host service. An agent can read its own runner's token while that
runner lives; that is the remaining exposure.

HappyClaw derives the local gateway address for host and container execution
automatically and keeps that hop out of any configured HTTP proxy. The saved
internal URL is a routing placeholder, not an external service to deploy or
expose separately.

Each provider identifies one authorization. It is not an account-rotation
pool. Requests refresh short-lived tokens when needed, share a single refresh
per provider, and re-read persisted credentials after concurrent changes.
A failed compare-and-swap never returns an old credential snapshot or
silently overwrites a reauthorization. An upstream 401 forces one shared
refresh and a single retry; a second 401 for the freshly refreshed token is
answered with `x-should-retry: false` and recorded as needing a new login,
so it never turns into a refresh loop. Refresh failures are classified like
the official client: only a 401, a 400 with `invalid_grant`, or the codes
`refresh_token_expired`, `refresh_token_reused` and
`refresh_token_invalidated` reject the grant. That is saved on the provider
as "needs re-login"; the gateway stops refreshing and answers an
authentication error that names the re-login until the credentials change.
Every other failure — network, timeout, 5xx/429 and any other 4xx such as a
Cloudflare 403 — is transient and backs off (30 seconds doubling to 5
minutes) while a still-valid access token keeps serving. A "needs re-login"
verdict saved by an earlier release for such a 4xx reads back as transient.
Refresh and revocation requests carry the official auth-client `originator`
and `User-Agent`.

### Protocol and operating limits

- Text, base64 images/PDFs, function tools, native web search and structured
  JSON output are translated into Codex Responses. Multimodal tool results
  keep their images inside the matching `function_call_output`. Long MCP
  names are mapped to unique short names and restored for the SDK.
- Top-level system text becomes developer input; SDK system reminders retain
  their position in the conversation, following matching tool results.
- Interleaved upstream tool arguments are buffered into serial Anthropic
  content blocks. Delta/done snapshots do not duplicate arguments; final
  output snapshots fill missing content. Native encrypted reasoning signatures
  pass through `thinking.signature`; previous HappyClaw envelopes remain
  readable. Both streaming and nonstream responses use the same converter.
- Cached and cache-write Responses input is subtracted from Anthropic
  `input_tokens` and reported separately as `cache_read_input_tokens` and
  `cache_creation_input_tokens`. Reasoning usage is preserved as a detail of
  output usage. Cache and reasoning details must not be counted twice.
- Source checks and authentication run before body buffering or
  rate-counter allocation. Each runner token has 120 requests per 60-second
  window; a limited request gets 429 with `Retry-After`. HappyClaw treats its
  own throttle as transient, so it never quarantines the provider. Rate state
  has a hard capacity of 1,024 active windows; a full table rejects new
  windows until expiry.
- Requests are capped at 32 MiB. Invalid message or tool shapes return 400
  naming the offending field path, never its value. Content the backend cannot
  take — image URLs or unsupported image types, non-PDF or URL documents,
  documents inside tool results, unknown block types — becomes a visible
  placeholder or its plain text, so one such block in the history does not
  fail every later turn.
- `POST /gateway/chatgpt/v1/messages/count_tokens` answers a local estimate
  without calling the backend: about 4 characters per token for prose, 3.2
  for JSON and code (tool arguments, schemas, symbol-dense text), one token
  per CJK character, a fixed cost for images and files, tool definitions
  whether top-level or inside a Responses Lite `additional_tools` item, and
  replayed encrypted reasoning by ciphertext length using the official
  client's formula. The same estimate fills `message_start` usage; the final
  `message_delta` reports the exact cache-exclusive counts. Because Claude
  Code keeps the `message_start` input whenever the delta reports 0, a fully
  cached prompt reports one cached token as input so the total stays exact.
- Reasoning effort, in this order: disabled thinking uses the model's lowest
  supported level; haiku-tier background requests use low; the effort picked
  for the conversation in the composer is used as is (Claude Code's own
  `output_config.effort` is ignored); an Agent with an explicit effort keeps
  it; otherwise `CODEX_REASONING_EFFORT` applies, falling back to the model's
  catalog default. Every result is clamped to the levels of the model the
  request runs on. The settings page shows the provider default.
- The official Codex CLI sets no response-header deadline on `/responses`
  and a 300-second stream idle deadline. The gateway waits up to 300 seconds
  for upstream headers (a queued request is not cut off early; the deadline
  covers only that attempt) and 300 seconds between stream chunks. A stall
  answers 504 for both response modes. Nonstream aggregation also has a
  ten-minute deadline and a 32 MiB budget. Individual SSE events are bounded.
  Downstream backpressure pauses upstream reading, and cancellation
  disconnects the upstream stream.
- Once a stream is released, 15 seconds without a downstream write send an
  `event: ping`. Claude Code's 300-second idle watchdog counts pings, so a
  long silent reasoning phase does not end the reply. No ping precedes
  `message_start`, and keepalive stops with the stream.
- Streams hold their first frames until content starts (at most 48 events,
  1 MiB or 20 seconds), so a failure reported before any content becomes a
  real HTTP status instead of 200 followed by an error event. A content
  block announced without content yet (an empty reasoning, text or tool
  start) still counts as handshake.
- Like the official client, 5xx answers and transport failures are retried up
  to four times with 200 ms exponential backoff (±10%), honoring
  `Retry-After`, and only while nothing has reached the client. Retries of
  one upstream request stay within 60 seconds; advice beyond that is
  returned to the client instead. 429 is never retried by the gateway. A
  stream that drops before any content counts as a transport failure.
- When the backend reports that it could not verify replayed reasoning
  (`invalid_encrypted_content`, for example ciphertext sealed by another
  account), the gateway drops the reasoning items from the request input and
  retries once.
- A response that ends with `end_turn: false`, or an `interrupted`
  incomplete response, is continued like the official client's follow-up:
  the gateway sends the previous output items again (requests are
  `store: false`) and streams the continuation into the same Anthropic
  message, with continuing block indexes and summed usage. At most four
  follow-ups are made; a response with a tool call always ends the message so
  the client can run it.
- A tool call cut by `max_output_tokens` ends the message with
  `max_tokens`: a call that had not started downstream is dropped, one that
  was already streaming is closed and never reported as `tool_use`.
  Refusal content without a tool call stops with `refusal`.
- An SSE frame whose data is not a JSON event object is skipped and counted
  in the logs, as the official client does; the stream continues.
- Success logs record model and usage counts. Upstream HTTP error bodies are
  read up to 64 KiB within five seconds; the client gets a redacted, bounded
  excerpt, and logs keep only status, code, type and the upstream
  `x-request-id`/`cf-ray`. Error classification follows the official client:
  usage limits become 429 with `Retry-After`, the reset time and
  `x-should-retry: false`; quota exhaustion (`insufficient_quota`,
  `credit_balance_exhausted`, spend/usage-limit codes) becomes a 429 that is
  not retried; policy rejections (`cyber_policy`, `bio_policy`,
  `misalignment_policy_violation`, `invalid_prompt`) become 400
  `invalid_request_error` that is not retried; `slow_down` and
  `rate_limit_exceeded` become 429, taking the delay from the streamed
  error's `Retry-After` header or a "try again in Xs" message; overload
  becomes 529; a plan without Codex (`usage_not_included`) becomes 403;
  context-length rejections become 400 "Prompt is too long", which Claude
  Code answers by compacting. Semantic terminal events close the upstream
  reader without waiting for the HTTP connection to close.
- The gateway reads the official `x-codex-*` rate-limit headers (primary and
  secondary used percent, window minutes and reset time per limit family,
  credits, active limit and rejection type) and in-band `codex.rate_limits`
  frames, and keeps the latest snapshot per provider in memory.
  `GET /api/config/claude/providers/:id/usage` returns it for a ChatGPT
  provider. When the usage window is exhausted and its reset time is known,
  the provider is quarantined in the provider pool until that reset.

### Official client identity and transport

Requests to the Codex backend mirror the official Codex CLI 0.162.1
(`codex-tui`; see `src/codex-gateway/client-identity.ts`):

- Identity: `originator: codex-tui`, `version: 0.162.1` on every request, and
  the official User-Agent format
  `codex-tui/0.162.1 (<OS> <version>; <arch>) <terminal> (codex-tui; 0.162.1)`
  describing the host that runs HappyClaw (a service without a terminal
  reports `unknown`). The authorization URL uses the same originator.
- Auth: `ChatGPT-Account-ID`, and `X-OpenAI-Fedramp: true` for FedRAMP
  accounts.
- Session and turn: the Claude Code session is the official session and the
  session plus Claude Code agent is the thread. Requests send `session-id`,
  `thread-id`, `x-client-request-id` (the thread), `x-codex-window-id`
  (`{thread}:0`; HappyClaw does not track Claude Code's local compaction
  windows) and `x-codex-turn-metadata`, plus the body's `client_metadata`
  with a per-install `installation_id` (`data/config/codex-installation-id`),
  session, thread, window and turn ids. `prompt_cache_key` is always sent:
  the thread id, or a deterministic key scoped to the runner and the
  conversation's opening when the SDK sends no session id. All derived ids
  are scoped to the provider and ChatGPT account.
- A request whose last user message carries new user content starts a turn;
  tool-result continuations (including reminders Claude Code attaches to the
  results) and retries of the same request stay in it. The first
  `x-codex-turn-state` the backend returns in a turn is replayed on the
  turn's later requests and dropped when the next turn starts. Turn state is
  kept in memory per provider, account and thread, with a one-hour idle TTL
  and at most 4,096 threads.
- Cookies: only the infrastructure cookies the official client keeps
  (`__cf_bm`, `__cflb`, `__cfruid`, `__cfseq`, `__cfwaitingroom`, `__oailb`,
  `_cfuvid`, `cf_clearance`, `cf_ob_info`, `cf_use_ob`, `cf_chl_*`) are stored,
  in a separate in-memory jar for each provider and account, and sent back on
  that account's requests. Account and session cookies are never stored.
- Background requests (haiku tier) take the shape of the official TUI's
  hidden title thread: a separate root thread (stable per conversation
  thread) with `thread_source: thread_title` in the turn metadata and no
  `x-openai-subagent`, whose official values describe reviewers, compaction,
  memory jobs and spawned agents. Their prompt cache key, also their
  `session-id`, is `thread_title:{conversation thread}`, so they share a
  cache without joining the conversation's.
- `x-openai-internal-codex-responses-lite: true` is sent exactly when the
  converted request is a Responses Lite request (it carries
  `reasoning.context: "all_turns"`); a request kept in the classic shape,
  such as one with hosted web search, omits it even on a Lite model.
- `x-codex-beta-features` is omitted. The official default list is only
  `remote_compaction_v2`, which advertises remote compaction and `compaction`
  output items; Claude Code compacts locally, so HappyClaw cannot honor it.
- Request bodies are compressed with zstd (`Content-Encoding: zstd`, level 3)
  like the official ChatGPT-auth default when the Node runtime provides
  `zlib.zstdCompressSync`; otherwise they are sent uncompressed.
- HTTP/2: Node 26's built-in fetch already negotiates HTTP/2 for direct
  connections. With `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` set, the global
  `EnvHttpProxyAgent` from the pinned undici 6 uses HTTP/1.1; enabling its
  `allowH2` is experimental in that release and would change every
  server-side fetch, so it is left off.
- WebSocket transport is not implemented. The official client keeps HTTP SSE
  as its supported fallback, and the gateway translates each Anthropic
  request into one independent Responses request; the WebSocket session's
  incremental input and connection reuse have no counterpart here.

The protocol implementation is ported from
[CLIProxyAPI a2976eb8](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI/tree/a2976eb8a303f11b4ea5177bce9f9ff752634dfc).
See [the compatibility matrix](codex-protocol-compatibility.md) for the source
functions, differential corpus, intentional runtime differences and remaining
verification boundaries. Its [MIT notice](licenses/CLIProxyAPI-MIT.txt) is
included with the port.

### Verify and recover

Send a short message in a workspace using the newly authorized provider.
Then verify a streamed reply, a tool round trip (including an image result
if your workflow uses screenshots), and usage history. Local protocol tests
use synthetic tokens and mocked upstream streams; they do not establish
that an account can access the live backend.

## External CLIProxyAPI gateway (optional)

The following deployment is separate from HappyClaw's built-in OAuth login.
Here CLIProxyAPI owns account credentials, refresh and pooling; HappyClaw
uses it as an ordinary third-party Anthropic-compatible provider.

### How the external gateway works

HappyClaw's provider system is Anthropic-native. The gateway sits between
HappyClaw and OpenAI: it owns the Codex OAuth login and token refresh, and
exposes an Anthropic-compatible `/v1/messages` endpoint (including tool use
and SSE streaming) that the Claude Agent SDK can consume directly.

```text
HappyClaw (Claude Agent SDK)
        │  Anthropic /v1/messages
        ▼
OAuth gateway (CLIProxyAPI, local Docker)
        │  Codex OAuth (device-code login, auto token refresh)
        ▼
ChatGPT / Codex backend
```

Two properties make this setup practical:

- The gateway translates between the Anthropic wire format and the Codex
  backend, so HappyClaw sees an ordinary third-party Anthropic-compatible
  provider.
- OAuth access tokens are short-lived; the gateway refreshes them
  automatically using the stored refresh token and rewrites the credential
  file in place.

### External prerequisites

- A ChatGPT account eligible for the Codex models you intend to use.
- In the ChatGPT web app, enable **Settings → Security → Device code
  login** for Codex on the account you plan to use. This is an
  account-level switch and must be enabled before the device-code flow
  below will succeed.
- Docker on the HappyClaw host.

### 1. Deploy the gateway

This guide uses [CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/eceasy/cli-proxy-api)
(`eceasy/cli-proxy-api`), which supports Codex OAuth accounts and an
Anthropic-compatible endpoint.

Create a working directory and a `config.yaml`:

```yaml
host: ''
port: 8317
tls:
  enable: false
remote-management:
  allow-remote: false
  secret-key: ''
auth-dir: '/root/.cli-proxy-api'
api-keys:
  - 'hcw_YOUR_OWN_RANDOM_KEY'
debug: false
```

Generate the key yourself, for example with `openssl rand -hex 24`. This
key is what HappyClaw will present as the provider API key — pick a fresh
random value per gateway instance.

Start the container:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/cpa/auths
docker run -d --name cpa-server --restart always \
  -p 172.17.0.1:8317:8317 \
  -v ~/cpa/auths:/root/.cli-proxy-api \
  -v ~/cpa/config.yaml:/CLIProxyAPI/config.yaml:ro \
  eceasy/cli-proxy-api:latest
```

Port binding notes (the `172.17.0.1` example is for Linux Docker):

- `172.17.0.1` is the Docker bridge gateway. Binding there keeps the
  service unreachable from the public internet while still reachable from
  other containers — required when HappyClaw runs Agents in Docker
  (container execution mode) and reaches the host through the bridge.
- If HappyClaw runs Agents directly on the host (host execution mode),
  bind to `127.0.0.1` instead.

### 2. Log in with a device code

Run the device-code login inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it cpa-server ./CLIProxyAPI -codex-device-login
```

It prints a code and a URL:

1. Open `https://auth.openai.com/codex/device`
2. Enter the printed device code
3. Sign in with the ChatGPT account you enabled device-code login for

On success the credential file (named after the account) appears in the
`auths/` directory, the gateway hot-reloads it without a restart, and the
account joins the serving pool.

### 3. Verify the gateway

```bash
# Model list
curl -s http://172.17.0.1:8317/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer hcw_YOUR_OWN_RANDOM_KEY"

# Minimal Anthropic-compatible request
curl -s http://172.17.0.1:8317/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: hcw_YOUR_OWN_RANDOM_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-5.6-sol","max_tokens":64,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say OK"}]}'
```

The exact model names depend on what the gateway exposes for your account;
pick one from `/v1/models` (for example `gpt-5.6-sol`). Tool use and SSE
streaming on `/v1/messages` work as with any Anthropic-compatible
endpoint.

### 4. Add the provider in HappyClaw

In the web UI, go to **Provider setup** (`/setup/providers`), create a
third-party provider, and fill in:

| Field      | Value                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base URL   | `http://172.17.0.1:8317` (or `127.0.0.1:8317` in host mode) |
| API Key    | The `api-keys` value from the gateway config                |
| Model name | A model from `/v1/models`, e.g. `gpt-5.6-sol`               |

Enable the provider and switch the target workspace to it. No other
HappyClaw configuration changes are needed.

### 5. Multiple accounts

Two layouts are supported:

- **Single instance, account pool.** Log in with each account as in step
  2; every credential file in `auth-dir` joins one pool and requests
  rotate between accounts. Quotas remain per account.
- **One instance per account.** Run a second container with its own
  `auth-dir`, config file, API key and host port (for example `8318`).
  This gives hard account isolation — useful when different workspaces
  must be pinned to different accounts, since each HappyClaw provider
  points at exactly one instance.

Both layouts refresh tokens independently; keeping the container running
(`restart: always`) is what keeps refreshes happening.

### External gateway security notes

- Never expose the gateway port publicly. Bind to the Docker bridge or
  loopback only, and keep `remote-management.allow-remote: false`.
- Credential files and gateway config contain OAuth tokens and API keys.
  Keep them outside any repository, and restrict directory permissions to
  the deploying user.
- The Anthropic-compatible endpoint is authenticated only by the shared
  API key, so treat anything that can reach the port as able to spend the
  linked subscription quota.
- Signing out of all sessions in the ChatGPT web app, changing the
  password, or revoking the authorization invalidates the refresh token;
  re-run the device-code login to recover.

### External gateway troubleshooting

| Symptom                                                 | Likely cause / fix                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Device login rejected, asks to enable device code login | Enable the account-level switch (see Prerequisites) on the exact account being signed in, then retry    |
| HappyClaw suddenly reports 401/403                      | The stored refresh token was revoked — re-run device-code login; verify with the curl checks in step 3  |
